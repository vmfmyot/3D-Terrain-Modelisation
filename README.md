# 3D Terrain Modelisation : a Computer Graphics project


This project was made for a Computer Graphics class, in our 2nd year of Computer Science bachelor's degree at Universit√© Paris-Saclay.\
It's a small 3D terrain simulation, with a 1st-person camera view allowing you to "walk" through the map.\
The project was coded in Processing, with GLSL shaders.

## Documentation
The only controls needed are keys.

If you want to "walk" through the map :
- Walk forward : up arrow
- Look to your :  right arrow
- Look to your left : left arrow
- Look upwards : A or Q
- Look downwards : Z or W
- Reset the angle of the camera : 0

Sidenote : if you try to walk out of bounds, it'll throw an error and you'll have to restart the program.

You can also show or hide some elements of the map :
- XYZ axis : R
- Electric lines : P
- Wind turbine (and the small "city" it's connected to) : E
